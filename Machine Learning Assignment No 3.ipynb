For example, if the machine learning model comes across a piece of data it is uncertain about, a human can be asked to weigh in and give feedback. The model then learns from this input, and uses it to make a more accurate prediction the next time. Human-guided machine learning works from the bottom up by first using algorithms to conduct the heavy lifting of identifying relationships within the data, and engaging humans when necessary for training or validation Concept Learning.\n",
